function should check if x is divisible by y only or z only or both y and z.
Example: If user entered values are 10, 2, and 5 then the output will be:
10 is divisible by both 2 and 5.
If user entered values are 10, 2, and 4 then the output will be: 10 is 
divisible by 2 only.
If user entered values are 10, 5, and 4 then the output will be: 10 is
