<!--1.4. Create a function with the following signature rangeDisplay(x,y,z) 
where x and y are two numeric values while z is a string value. The 
function should display the following:
•The range of numbers between x and y depending on the value of z 
according to the following:
o If z=”odd” the function will display only the odd values between x 
and y. x and/or y are included if any is odd.
o If z=”even” the function will display only the even values between x 
and y. x and/or y are included if any is even.
o If z=”no” the function will display all values between x and y. x and y 
are included.
o If z=”odd” the function will display only the odd values between x 
and y.
o Make sure that the user entered the proper data type for each 
parameter, if not, inform the user to re-enter the required 
parameters.
•The sum of the displayed numbers.
•Apply a displaying style in console.
The output will be either descending (if x>y) or ascending order (if x<y)
Example: If user entered values are 9,15 and answered the question 
about the even and odd with “no” then the output will be: 
9,10,11,12,13,14,15 and their sum value that is 84
If the answer is “odd” then the output will be: 9,11,13,15 and their sum 
value that is 48
If the answer is “even” then the output will be: 10,12,14 and their sum
value that is 36-->
